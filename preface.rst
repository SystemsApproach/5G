Preface 
=======

The transition to 5G is happening, and unless you've been actively
trying to ignore it, you've undoubtedly heard the hype. But if you are
like 99% of the CS-trained, systems-oriented, cloud-savvy people in
the world, the cellular network is largely a mystery. You know it's an
important technology used in the last mile to connect people to the
Internet, but you've otherwise abstracted it out of your
scope-of-concerns. Perhaps you've heard a conspiracy theory or two
about how 5G is going to cause some awful side-effect—a sign that the
hype around 5G might not be working as intended.

The important thing to understand about 5G is that it implies much more 
than a generational upgrade in bandwidth (although it does involve
that too). It involves transformative 
changes to the access network that will make it much more like a
modern cloud. Important technology trends such as software-defined
networking (SDN) and open source software will lead to an
access network that is much more nimble and innovative. And 
it will enable new classes of application, particularly a broad set of
IoT (Internet of Things) applications. In fact we could even see the
“Access-as-frontend-to-Internet” perspective being turned on its head, as the
access network itself becomes a collection of clouds with new services
delivered directly from "edge clouds".

This book is written for someone who has a working understanding of the 
Internet and the cloud, but has had limited success penetrating the myriad 
of acronyms that dominate cellular networking. In fairness, the Internet 
has its share of acronyms, but it also comes with a sufficient set of 
abstractions to help manage the complexity. It’s hard to say the same 
for the cellular network, where pulling on one thread seemingly unravels 
the entire space. It has also been the case that the cellular network 
had been largely hidden inside proprietary devices, which has made it 
impossible to figure it out for yourself. 

This book is the result of a mobile networking expert teaching a 
systems person about 5G as we've collaborated on an open source 5G 
implementation. The material has been used to train other software 
developers, and we are hopeful it will be useful to anyone who wants a 
deeper understanding of 5G and the opportunity for innovation it 
provides. Readers who want hands-on experience can also access the open 
source software introduced in the book. 

This book will likely be a work-in-progress for the foreseeable future. 
It’s not intended to be encyclopedic—favoring perspective and end-to-end 
completeness over every last bit of detail—but we do plan to flesh out 
the content over time. Your suggestions (and contributions) to this end 
are welcome.
